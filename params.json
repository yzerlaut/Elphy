{"name":"Elphy","tagline":"the Electrophysiology Software","body":" At the beginning, Elphy is a software designed to meet the needs of researchers of the UNIC laboratory ( Unité de Neurosciences Integratives et Computationnelles - CNRS ).  We can consider that it is the Windows successor of Acquis1, an old MS-DOS software marketed by companies DIPSI and BIOLOGIC, although its field of application is far more extensive and that its programming language differs significantly from that of Acquis1 by use of object programming. \r\n\r\n In the past, Elphy was also called DAC1 or DAC2.  Elphy was originally designed to analyze the files created by Acquis1, or by Axon softwares. Later, we introduced a Data Acquisition module, then a Visual Stimulation module. \r\n\r\n Today, Elphy is mainly used in the field of Electrophysiology but it is built like a general purpose DAQ software and could be used in others domains.    Elphy can control an experiment through multifunction interfaces provided by National Instrument, MCC , Instrutech , AXON, UEI or Blackrock-microsystems.  Data acquired on this devices can be analyzed and presented in real-time on a PC, using a built-in programming language.  This language include about 160 dedicated objects and 2500 functions ( in june 2010 ) \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGérard Sadoc (1995-...)\r\n\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
